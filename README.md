**[2] Sparsifying Parametric Models with L$_0$ Regularization** \
Nicolò Botteghi and Urban Fasel \
This document contains an educational introduction to the problem of sparsifying parametric models with L0 regularization. We utilize this approach together with dictionary learning to learn sparse polynomial policies for deep reinforcement learning to control parametric partial differential equations.
